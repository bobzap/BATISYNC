-- Drop existing policies

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view project members for their projects" ON project_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Project admins can manage project members" ON project_members;

-- Create new simplified policies

-- Project members policies
CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for all users"
  ON project_members FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated

CREATE POLICY "Enable insert for authenticated users"
  ON project_members FOR INSERT

-- Note: These are temporary permissive policies for development
-- They should be replaced with proper role-based policies in production
